> **Privacy-preserving AI made simple** - A comprehensive toolkit for data privacy risk assessment and de-identification in Python-based ML pipelines.

READI augments the functionalities provided by [IBM Data Privacy Toolkit](https://github.com/IBM/data-privacy-toolkit), offering state-of-the-art capabilities for detecting Personal and Sensitive Information in unstructured documents. Built for modern compliance frameworks and AI model training workflows.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Advanced PII Detection** - Identify personal and sensitive information across multiple data types
- 🔄 **Seamless Integration** - Low-effort integration with existing ML pipelines
- 📊 **Structured & Unstructured Data** - Support for both data formats
- 🌐 **REST API** - Easy-to-use HTTP interface for remote processing
- 🧪 **Extensible Framework** - Modular design for custom privacy requirements
- 📝 **Comprehensive Examples** - Jupyter notebooks with real-world use cases

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) support (for large files >50 MB)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) - A fast Python package installer

### Installation

**Recommended: Using uv (10-100x faster)**
```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install READI
uv pip install git+https://github.com/IBM/READI.git
```

**Standard Installation with pip:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/IBM/READI.git
```

**Clone Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/READI.git
cd READI

# With uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e .

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

---

## 💻 Development Setup

For contributors and developers:

**Recommended: Using uv**
```bash
# Install in editable mode with development dependencies
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
pre-commit install
```

**Alternative: Using pip**
```bash
# Install in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
pre-commit install
```

This installs the project in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) along with development tools (pytest, ruff, bandit, etc.).

> 💡 **Tip**: Using `uv` provides significantly faster dependency resolution and installation compared to traditional `pip`.

---

## 🌐 REST API Usage

READI provides a simple REST API for remote processing.

### Setup

```bash
# Install with REST API support
pip install -e '.[rest]'

# Start the server
uvicorn risk_assessment.entry_points.rest.api:app
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     http://localhost:8000/detect_phi \
     --data-raw '{"text":"My text with email: john@gmail.com"}'
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with interactive documentation at `/docs`.
